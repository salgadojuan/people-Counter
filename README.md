# people-Counter
A JavaScript Practice run, using Scrimba's Learn JavaScript platform. This small app allows a user to count passengers entering a train, I changed the background image and styled the buttons "Count Passengers & Save" with different colors so that the finsihed web app is not identical. The FinsihedProject.png file attached is an image of the finished product.
